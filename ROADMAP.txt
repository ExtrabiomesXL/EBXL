This update to 1.12 is mean as EBXL's 4.0 release. A few features will be
trimmed, and a few will be added - but for the most part, it is meant to be
simply a cleanup and port of the old 1.7 version.

This is a brief snapshot of my plans as of late Nov '17 (one week into dev on
the update). - Al

Biomes
----------
Confirmed
 - Autumn Woods
 - Green Hills
 - Green Swamp
 - Meadow
 - Red Rock Desert (was "Mountain Ridge", may go with "Red Rock Ridge" instead?)
 - Redwood Forest
 - Wasteland
 - Woodlands
 - Rainforest

Maybe
 - Alpine

The remainder of the biomes in the original mod are likely not going to be kept
around as they are either implemented in vanilla now or simply not unique enough
to warrant keeping around. This issue is still very much in flux.

Blocks
----------
Confirmed
 - Red Rock (stone & cobble)
 - Cracked Sand
 - Quicksand
 - Flowers (likely ~30 varieties)
 - Gloriosa vines, Eelgrass, cattails
 - Strawberries

New (Maybe)
 - Wild onions and rice

Trees
----------
Confirmed
 - Autumn (4 variants)
 - Redwood
 - Cypress, Bald Cypress
 - Rainbow Eucalyptus
 - Japanese Maple
 - Sakura

New (Maybe)
 - Willow
 - Reduce autumn to a single sapling type and randomly determine leaf color
 - Add cherries as a drop from sakura leaves

Shrubs are not currently planned for inclusion.

The fir tree is in question currently, as it needs a lot of help. Once the mod
is up and running again, serious consideration of new features will be made,
including a cleanup pass on fir rendering and the addition of other trees from
our library of legacy inherited assets.

Recipes & Misc Features
----------
Confirmed
 - Slabs & Staircases
 - Dyes from flowers
 
Maybe
 - Chocolate (and chocolate strawberries)
 - Doors
 - Fences

I would consider doing custom chests, but there was already an addon mod from
the community that did this with our wood. I might roll it in first party, but
it's low priority if it happens.

The scarecrow is not currently planned for re-implementation.
